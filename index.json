Making money by mowing lawns, yard work, odd jobs, and whatever project my parents or neighbors didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do. I developed my love for computers and systems very early on when I learned how to squeze every bit of ram out of my dell computer to create websites and mod minecraft.\nI ended up majoring in computer science where I further developed my love for how we can enhance our daily lives and create really awesome things by the use of computers. I had great opportunities to work on incredible projects at Dynatrace and Comerica Bank via internships as I went through college. Since graduation, I\u0026rsquo;ve looked to be apart of teams and organizations that are driven toward a mission of developing awesome services and features. I also really love being apart of companies, where as an engineer, I can be involved on the business side of things. This is due to the ardent need to excersise the entrepeneur side of me. This has led me to be apart of Dynatrace, Gamestop, and Shipium in my professional tenure.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Professional I started my profressional career as a whee lad.","title":""},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
