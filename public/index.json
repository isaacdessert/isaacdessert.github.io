Making money by mowing lawns, yard work, odd jobs, and whatever project my parents or neighbors didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do. I developed my love for computers and systems very early on when I learned how to squeze every bit of compute power out of my 10 year old dell brick to create websites and mod minecraft.\nI ended up majoring in computer science where I further developed my love for how we can enhance our daily lives and create really awesome things by the use of computers. Since graduation, I\u0026rsquo;ve looked to be apart of teams and organizations that are driven toward a mission of developing awesome services and features. I also really love being apart of companies, where as an engineer, I can be involved on the business side of things. This is due to the ardent need to excersise the entrepeneur side of me.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested about my past experience feel free to checkout my resume (pdf).\n","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"About I started my working career as a whee lad.","title":""},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
