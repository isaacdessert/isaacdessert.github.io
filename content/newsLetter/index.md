# What To Expect

#### 1 - Become a better board gamer

Every newsletter will have a tip on how to become a better board game player.  These aren't individual tips on specific board games (although there may be some), these are tips on how to think about playing games to become better at them.

#### 2 - Discover new board games

Every newsletter will spotlight a board game.  I will articulate exactly which type of audience would enjoy the game the most and the replayability of it.  This is a great place to hear and learn about new board games.

#### 3 - Discover up and coming board games

Every newsletter will spotlight a new and upcoming board game.  I will point to different kick starter and recent game releases that I haven't gotten my hands on but are extremely promising.
