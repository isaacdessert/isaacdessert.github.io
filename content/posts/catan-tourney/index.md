I had the privilage to play and win a Catan National Qualifier last week.  I came in not expecting much as it was the first time I competed in a competitive board game environment.

## How I won

As is the general form in Catan a lot of the game comes down to the roll of the dice.  I got crushed one of the qualifying games with only 4 points because the 9 was rolled more than the 6 and 8 combined!  Largely to increase your odds there are a number of useful things to hedge your odds against.  The things I like prioritize is controlling scarce resources and being specialized in brick, wheat or stone.  I also prefer to go for a development card/city strategy.  I find this to be very powerful.  I generally see opponents get less concerned about a stack of development cards than roads and settlements.  I won the final game decisively by hording a stack of development cards and playing a timely monopoly that pushed be far enough ahead where I couldn't be caught.

####  If you are a beginner reading this I would recommend staying away from the following mistakes:

- **Placing your two settlements on similar numbers**
  - This would look like placing your first settlement on an 8-5-4 and also on a 5-4-9.  This results in a feast or famine situation.  If you played 100 games on these placements, though good, you would likely dominate or be dominated.  That's why for a chance at consistent wins or fighting chances I suggest diversifying your placements.
- **Too Much Sheep or Wood**
  - These two resources are generally the most plentiful and the least useful.  Unless you are going for a port, I would not recommend prioritizing these.
- **Trading Poorly**
  - Negotiation is one of the most important parts of catan.  I see so many people do this poorly by overextending too early in trade. When in doubt don't trade unless you can immediatly make something or if its not your turn. Also, leverage all of your assets and put your negotiation hat on.  Honestly a book could be written on this, and probably has been.  Consider the following things and leverage them when trading.
    - Whose turn is it?
    - Who's winning?
    - Do I have a large hand?
    - Does my opponent have a large hand?
    - How valuable is this resource in this game?
    - How valuable is this resource to them (do they have a port, etc...)?
    - What's the trade ratio?

## My improvements

The thing I am working on more as I get ready for the US Catan national tournament is to focus more on how my initial settlement placements affect my opponents.  Although my settlment might be slightly worse to move one space over, does that have a large impact on one or two of my opponents?  I also am trying to put more weight on holding onto prized resources longer.  I did a number of 4 to 1 trades for brick or other commodities just to find myself scrounging for brick a few turns later.  The die move in one direction and then back in the other direction, it's good to be ready when brick or any resource becomes scarce for a turn or two.
